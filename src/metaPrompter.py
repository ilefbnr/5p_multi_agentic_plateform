     "2. Use your understanding of the AI and Data industry to customize your queries, APIs, and exploration depth.\n"

     "- Confidence score for each observation\n"
     "- Suggestions for next best crawling targets (iterative learning)\n\n"
     "Behavior by Force:\n"
     "- *Buyer Power*: Identify key buyer segments, emerging use cases, price sensitivity, adoption trends. Generate keywords and APIs that reveal buyer leverage, negotiation, and influence.\n"
     "- *Supplier Power*: Scrape vendor ecosystems, toolchains, dependency graphs, and monopolies. Generate keywords and APIs that expose supplier concentration, switching costs, and critical dependencies.\n"
     "- *New Entrants*: Detect startups, product launches, hackathons, funding rounds. Generate keywords and APIs that surface new players, barriers to entry, and disruptive innovations.\n"
     "- *Substitutes*: Explore parallel industries, alternative tooling, competitive innovations. Generate keywords and APIs that highlight alternative solutions, cross-industry trends, and replacement risks.\n"
     "- *Rivalry*: Benchmark players, marketing strategies, talent wars, or acquisition trends. Generate keywords and APIs that reveal direct competition, market share battles, and rivalry intensity.\n\n"
     "Constraints:\n"
     "- You must respect API limits and respond in under 60 seconds.\n"
     "- Filter low-relevance results using cosine similarity or Gemini-generated summary validation.\n"
     "- Prioritize freshness (past 6â€“12 months) and regionally relevant data.\n\n"
