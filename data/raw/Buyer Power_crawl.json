The Rise of AI in B2B Sales Artificial Intelligence has been making waves across industries for years, but its application in B2B sales is reaching new heights. According to McKinsey, by 2025, AI is expected to play a crucial role in B2B sales strategies, with generative AI driving significant advances in personalization and efficiency across the buyer's journey. AI's ability to tailor experiences at every touchpoint makes it an indispensable tool for enhancing customer engagement and sales outcomes​ ( McKinsey & Company ). Previously, creating custom data insights required specialized knowledge. Now, AI tools simplify this process, letting you generate valuable insights and tailored strategies without needing a data scientist. This means your team can quickly access and use data to personalize interactions, improve customer engagement, and make smarter decisions—no technical expertise required. The need for B2B personalization is growing, and according to one study by Accenture, 73% of B2B buyers now want a personalized B2C-like experience. \"AI personalization is not just about tailoring messages; it's about creating entire ecosystems of personalized experiences throughout the B2B buyer's journey.\" Why Personalization is Essential in B2B Sales Personalization has become more than just a buzzword; it's a critical strategy for success in the competitive B2B arena, enhancing customer experiences and driving business growth ​( Intandemly ). Here's why: Increased Engagement: Tailored content and interactions capture and maintain attention in a world of information overload. Personalized messaging can break through the noise, making your communication stand out. Improved Conversion Rates: When offers and solutions are precisely aligned with a business's needs, the likelihood of conversion skyrockets. Personalization ensures that your offers resonate more deeply with potential clients. Enhanced Customer Experience: Personalized journeys foster stronger relationships and build trust between businesses. This leads to longer-lasting partnerships and customer loyalty, which is crucial in the B2B space. In fact, B2B buyers are increasingly seeking the personalized, seamless experiences typically associated with B2C interactions. Higher ROI: By focusing resources on the most promising leads and strategies, businesses can significantly improve their return on investment. Key AI Personalization Tools Shaping B2B Sales “AI Can Help You Manage at Scale: AI’s capacity to automate complex processes and analyze vast amounts of data enables businesses to manage their operations efficiently at scale.” As we look towards 2025, several AI-powered tools are emerging as game-changers in the B2B sales landscape: The Impact of AI Personalization on B2B Sales AI personalization is revolutionizing B2B sales by enhancing core processes and reshaping strategic approaches. Here’s how AI is transforming the landscape: Core Sales Processes Lead Generation and Scoring AI algorithms analyze extensive data to identify high-quality leads and predict their conversion potential. This integrated approach helps sales teams generate targeted leads and prioritize their outreach efforts based on predicted likelihood of conversion. Content Creation and Curation AI-powered tools automate the generation and curation of personalized content, ensuring that prospects receive tailored information relevant to their specific needs and stages in the buying journey. Sales Outreach and Follow-up Automated, personalized email sequences and AI-driven scheduling tools streamline the outreach process, ensuring timely and relevant communication with prospects. Dynamic Pricing AI analyzes market conditions, competitor pricing, and individual customer data to offer optimized, real-time pricing tailored to each customer. Predictive Analytics for Sales Forecasting Advanced AI models provide accurate sales forecasts by evaluating a variety of factors, enabling businesses to make informed, data-driven decisions. The commerce landscape has evolved significantly over the past decade. Ten years ago, the traditional commerce flow was from manufacturer > wholesaler > distributor > retail. This structure is no longer as discrete, with many B2B businesses now engaging in various levels of each function, such as assembly, bundling, and heavy manufacturing. Today, businesses must navigate interconnected systems and figure out how to reach direct-to-consumer (D2C) channels through existing structures without disrupting their traditional channels. The broader adoption of generative AI further amplifies these benefits by enabling hyper-personalized marketing and sales strategies. AI's ability to provide granular insights and automate complex processes is helping companies streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and ultimately boost B2B sales performance ( McKinsey & Company ). In this evolving landscape, AI not only addresses the complexities introduced by interconnected systems and diversified functions but also drives growth and improves sales effectiveness by offering targeted, data-driven strategies that align with the modern commerce environment.

Marketers seeking to enhance engagement with AI have an evolving tightrope to walk. 83% of companies said they are now actively integrating AI into their customer experience programs, per SupportNinja’s 2025 report. That said, preference for human connection is the top reason US consumers prefer to deal with real people than AI search, per a December Pearl.com survey. “AI is just making the customer journey more efficient for consumers,” said our analyst Suzy Davidkhanian in a recent “ Behind the Numbers ” episode, “but it comes at the price of losing the treasure hunt and impulse purchases.” With the right guardrails, marketers and retailers can implement AI chatbots into their customer service strategy while maintaining sales and driving customer loyalty. Consumers still want to be active shoppers Chatbots are the most popular use case for AI in the digital experience for marketers worldwide, per a September survey from Advanis and Sitecore. However, when it comes to chatbot implementation, consumers aren’t sold on speed alone. Some 86% said empathy and human connection matter more than a quick response, per Five9’s 2025 Customer Experience Report. 72% of consumers are open to AI-powered interactions as long as they can escalate to a human if needed, per the report. An important element of AI is its ability to understand the context of a consumer’s query. The chatbot should approach the conversation differently depending on whether the user is looking for a quick fix or has time to browse, said Davidkanian. “Because AI is supposed to be smarter and more human-like, it might be able to understand some of those nuances and move you in the right direction,” she said. What it means for advertisers: When seeking to offer customers more impactful engagement, advertisers should consider leaning on first-party data to anticipate consumer needs and incorporate them into chatbot model training to provide the best service possible. Considering a mutual learning curve As marketers try to build chatbot trust with consumers, they're also having to keep in mind that these chatbots will likely have to interact with other AI agents as well. This machine-to-machine marketing (M2M) can make it challenging to dial in messaging both tuned for AI and conversational for customers. Almost three-quarters of US executives (74%) see a role for AI agents in their businesses in 2025, according to December 2024 data from Boston Consulting Group. “Brands are now optimizing for an AI audience in addition to a traditional hu",

You donât have to read part one or two to benefit from this article, but it will help connect all the dots to change the way you think about your website performance. --- If you follow the latest developments in the sales industry, youâve probably heard the phrase âbuyer intentâ (aka âpurchase intentâ) more than a few times in the past few years. Unlike other popular buzzwords that seem to come and go, buyer intent digs deep into the foundation of any sales process and thus should gain your full attention.Â G2, the largest tech marketplace, defines buyer intent as âthe probability that a customer will purchase a productâ and similarly defines buyer-intent tools as those that âcapture research around actual buyer journeys and signs of their purchase intent.â In other words, buyer intent can be interpreted as a spectrum which measures how likely someone is to purchase a given product or service.Â Think of a typical buyer journey today. Hardly anyone just visits a website (or walks into a retail store) without the preliminary research already done. Since nearly all that research happens online (ideally on your website), you have to be able to discover and capture the buying intent of all website visitors.Â The problem, however, is that most of your website visitors are anonymous. Marketo estimates that up to 98% of those who visit your website donât have any apparent characteristics that could identify them in real time. Up to 98% of your visitors are anonymous So, how do you decipher the buyer intent of someone who is completely anonymous to you? Letâs start by taking a step back and reviewing the different types of visitor intelligence today. The Different Types of Visitor Intelligence Data Thereâs a big difference between identifying a visitor and identifying their intent. In digital marketing we typically work with three different types of intelligence in this arena: Identity : The attribute(s) by which we can identify who a visitor actually is. This information may be in the form of an IP address that can be related to a corporate domain, a device-ID that can be cross-referenced to prior identifiable behavior, a first-party or third-party cookie that can identify the visitor in terms of prior website activity, and/or an email address that can uniquely associate the visitor with online and offline information, often in a CRM system Fit: The ability to profile the identified visitor against demographic attributes (age, sex, income, etc.) in the case of an individual consumer and/or firmographic attributes (company size, industry, annual revenue, etc.) in the case of a known business. In each case, marketers can segment and qualify their visitors in terms of their hypothetical 'fit' for their product/service based on the data.Â Buyer Intent : The set of behavioral signals that show the intention of your prospects to purchase a product or service. Your prospects are actively seeking solutions, looking for vendors which might offer products or services to address the problems they have. They search online, consume content, conduct extensive reviews, and ultimately leave a âdigital exhaustâ trail that shows what theyâre possibly seeking. Each data type serves a different purpose in advancing our understanding of website visitors, including which of those represent the best prospects to acquire our products and services and thereby how we should invest resources to convert that interest. The Problem with Identity-First Marketing Conventional wisdom has been to first establish the identity of a visitor (e.g. find out who they are, what company they work for, their email address) and then see if their profile is a fit against your ICP (ideal customer profile) and only then try to understand what their intent is for being on your website.Â To summarize, the traditional approach is to decipher a visitorâs identity, then fit, thenÂ  intent in that order. It's logical, but it's not the most effective way to capture the full potential of your website. Why? Because this approach forces your visitors through a limiting filter of identity.Â  Only those visitors who can be identified are profiled and ultimately engaged. In a world of ever-increasing privacy with the elimination of cookies, the elimination of cross-website tracking, and the increased use of VPNs, it is getting harder and harder to identify your website visitors. Considering the high barrier to obtaining identity information, that means only a fraction of your website traffic will be identified and engaged.Â As mentioned, Marketo famously declared that 98% of website visitors are anonymous with no identifying attributes. A whole industry has grown up around the desire to identify or infer the identity of website visitors or at least what company they may belong to. It's a challenge. Most data enhancement tools struggle to identify the individual visitors more than 20-30% at the best of times. Some tools may infer what company the visitor belongs to 50-60% of the time, but that's not the individual, just the company. From there, marketers and sales teams will figure out if that identified individual has the right fit against their ICP, and only then go through the motions (via chat or other means) to determine if theyâre even likely to buy or become a lead. So, run the math. If you can only identify 30% of your visitors (at best), what about the other 70% - the vast majority of your traffic? If your marketing strategy is predicated on finding the identity of a visitor before you can qualify and engage them, you're not only missing out on the majority of the opportunity hitting your website, you're fighting the momentum toward ever greater privacy. This is the problem with identity-first marketing. Intent: The Key to Unlock your Full Potential So, how do you avoid the identity-first limitation? What if you could turn the conventional wisdom (and order of things) on its head? What if you could know the intent of every visitor on your website and then optimize your engagement tactics to convert the highest potential visitors with your best resources, maximizing your ROI on digital marketing? Imagine if instead of the Identity â Fit â Intent sequence, it was Intent â Fit â Identity? First, you determine the intent of every visitor, then determine if they're a good fit for your offering, and finally seek their identity once you have engaged them. If you could do this, you'd no longer have to harass every visitor, asking for their email on the slightest pretext. More than 50% of visitors will abandon your web experience when you ask for an email address too early. So, just like the best Nordstrom salesperson, you could let shoppers ask questions without asking them first for their personal information. Instead, you could determine their intent by observing their behavior and then engage those with the highest buying potential when the moment is just right (more on this later). What is \"Intent\" Exactly? There are generally three types of \"intent\" that we encounter in digital marketing: In-Market Intent: This is the implied intent attributed to an individual visitor if that visitor can be successfully associated with the domain of a known corporation. Based on the recorded behavior of other individuals in the company on other web assets or their engagement with published digital materials, an in-market intent hypothesis can be formed that the company may be interested in or actively acquiring assets similar ",

    "raw_content": "Marketing and sales soar with generative AI | McKinsey Skip to main content AI-powered marketing and sales reach new heights with generative AI May 11, 2023 | Article Richelle Deveau Â Sonia Joseph Griffin Â Steve Reis AI technology has revolutionized marketing and sales; now, generative AI promises to disrupt the way B2B and B2C players think about customer experience, productivity, and growth. (11 pages) Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in marketing and sales. And now, with the ongoing step-change evolution of generative AI (gen AI), weâre seeing the use of open-source platforms penetrating to the sales frontlines, along with rising investment by sales-tech players in gen AI innovations. Given the accelerating complexity and speed of doing business in a digital-first world, these technologies are becoming essential tools. Inevitably, this will impact how you operateâand how you connect with and serve your customers. In fact, itâs probably already doing so. Forward-thinking C-suite leaders are considering how to adjust to this new landscape. Here, we outline the marketing and sales opportunities (and risks) in this dynamic field and suggest productive paths forward. Our research suggests that a fifth of current sales-team functions could be automated. How AI is reshaping marketing and sales AI is poised to disrupt marketing and sales in every sector. This is the result of shifts in consumer sentiment alongside rapid technological change. Omnichannel is table stakes Across industries, engagement models are changing: todayâs customers want everything, everywhere, and all the time. While they still desire an even mix of traditional, remote, and self-service channels (including face-to-face, inside sales, and e-commerce), we see continued growth in customer preference for online ordering and reordering. Winning companiesâthose increasing their market share by at least 10 percent annuallyâtend to utilize advanced sales technology; build hybrid sales teams and capabilities; tailor strategies for third-party and company-owned marketplaces; achieve e-commerce excellence across the entire funnel; and deliver hyper-personalization (unique messages for individual decision makers based on their needs, profile, behaviors, and interactionsâboth past and predictive). Step changes are occurring in digitization and automation What is generative AI? Many of us are already familiar with online AI chatbots and image generators, using them to create convincing pictures and text at astonishing speed. This is the great power of generative AI, or gen AI: it utilizes algorithms to generate new contentâwriting, images, or audioâfrom training data. To do this, gen AI uses deep-learning models called foundation models (FMs). FMs are pre-trained on massive datasets and the algorithms they support are adaptable to a wide variety of downstream tasks, including content generation. Gen AI can be trained, for example, to predict the next word in a string of words and can generalize that ability to multiple text-generation tasks, such as writing articles, jokes, or code. In contrast, âtraditionalâ AI is trained on a single task with human supervision, using data specific to that task; it can be fine-tuned to reach high precision, but must be retrained for each new use case. Thus gen AI represents an enormous step change in power, sophistication, and utilityâand a fundamental shift in our relationship to artificial intelligence. AI technology is evolving at pace. It is becoming increasingly easy and less costly to implement, while offering ever-accelerating complexity and speed that far exceeds human capacity. Our research suggests that a fifth of current sales-team functions could be automated. In addition, new frontiers are opening with the rise of gen AI (see sidebar âWhat is generative AI?â). Furthermore, venture capital investment in AI has grown 13-fold over the last ten years. 1 Nestor Maslej et al., âThe AI Index 2023 annual report,â AI Index Steering Committee, Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, April 2023. This has led to an explosion of âusableâ data (data that can be used to formulate insights and suggest tangible actions) and accessible technology (such as increased computation power and open-source algorithms). Vast, and growing, amounts of data are now available for foundation-model training, and since 2012 thereâs been a millionfold increase in computation capacityâdoubling every three to four months. 2 Cliff Saran, âStanford University finds that AI is outpacing Mooreâs Law,â Computer Weekly, December 12, 2019; Risto Miikkulainen, âCreative AI through evolutionary computation: Principles and examples,â SN Computer Science, 2(3): 163, March 23, 2001. Would you like to learn more about our Growth, Marketing & Sales Practice ? What does gen AI mean for marketing and sales? The rise of AI, and particularly gen AI, has potential for impact in three areas of marketing and sales: customer experience (CX), growth, and productivity. For example, in CX, hyper-personalized content and offerings can be based on individual customer behavior, persona, and purchase history. Growth can be accelerated by leveraging AI to jumpstart top-line performance, giving sales teams the right analytics and customer insights to capture demand. Additionally, AI can boost sales effectiveness and performance by offloading and automating many mundane sales activities, freeing up capacity to spend more time with customers and prospective customers (while reducing cost to serve). In all these actions, personalization is key. AI coupled with company-specific data and context has enabled consumer insights at the most granular level, allowing B2C lever personalization through targeted marketing and sales offerings. Winning B2B companies go beyond account-based marketing and disproportionately use hyper-personalization in their outreach. Bringing gen AI to life in the customer journey There are many gen AI-specific use cases across the customer journey that can drive impact: A gen AI sales use case: Dynamic audience targeting and segmentation Gen AI can combine and analyze large amounts of dataâsuch as demographic information, existing customer data, and market trendsâto identify additional audience segments. Its algorithms then enable businesses to create personalized outreach content, easily and at scale. Instead of spending time researching and creating audience segments, a marketer can leverage gen AIâs algorithms to identify segments with unique traits that may have been overlooked in existing customer data. Without knowing every detail about these segments, they can then ask a gen AI tool to draft automatically tailored content such as social media posts and landing pages. Once these have been refined and reviewed, the marketer and a sales leader can use gen AI to generate further content such as outreach templates for a matching sales campaign to reach prospects. Embracing these techniques will require some openness to change. Organizations will require a comprehensive and aggregated dataset (such as an operational data lake that pulls in disparate sources) to train a gen AI model that can generate relevant audience segments and content. Once trained, the model can be operationalized within commercial systems to streamline workflows while being continuously refined by agile processes. Lastly, the commercial organizational structure and operating model may need to be adjusted to ensure appropriate levels of risk oversight are in place and performance assessments align to the new ways of working. At the top of the funnel, gen AI surpasses traditional AI-driven lead identification and targeting that uses web scraping and simple prioritization. Gen AIâs advanced algorithms can leverage patterns in customer and market data to segment and target relevant a",

Share Share Blog Apr 14, 2025 14 minute read On this page Did you ever wonder how Spotify compiles its daily mix of tunes you’d like to hear? Or how Netflix makes recommendations of films you’re sure to enjoy? Thank the marketing professionals who are using artificial intelligence to zero in on what consumers most want to see, hear, read, and purchase. From chatbots to social media management to full-scale marketing campaigns and automation, artificial intelligence is changing the way marketers do their jobs. Routine tasks like writing copy, mining consumer data, and creating visuals that once took hours can now be done in minutes. Businesses should view AI as an opportunity to provide more customized and relevant marketing experiences for their customers and ultimately drive their business forward. Meet Our Expert Learn more about Christina Christina Inge , author of “Marketing Analytics: A Comprehensive Guide and Marketing Metrics,” and instructor at the Harvard Division of Continuing Education’s Professional & Executive Development, calls AI both a challenge and an opportunity for those in marketing. “There is a saying going around now — and it is very true— that your job will not be taken by AI,” says Inge. “It will be taken by a person who knows how to use AI. So, it is very important for marketers to know how to use AI.” At present, many marketers are underutilizing AI, but the impact of AI in marketing is already transforming the business landscape, helping leaders make data-informed decisions with greater efficiency and accuracy. From predictive insights to immersive experiences, AI is redefining how marketers handle repetitive tasks, make decisions, and connect with customers. While there are challenges ahead, the industry is changing, and professionals who want to future-proof their careers must master the use of AI. The Current State of AI in Marketing How will AI impact marketing? AI platforms like HubSpot, Constant Contact, Mailchimp, and ActiveCampaign are already being used by marketers to automate tasks and optimize campaigns. The 2024 State of Marketing AI Report from the Marketing AI Institute says AI adoption is accelerating among marketing professionals, with many saying they use AI in digital tools in their daily workflows and “couldn’t live without AI.” How marketers use AI tools Reducing time spent on repetitive, data-driven tasks like content marketing, email, social media, or customer relationship management Gaining more actionable insights from data Accelerating revenue growth Unlocking greater value from marketing technologies According to Inge, marketers are using AI for market research, creating reports about the state of an industry or sector, and demonstrating ideas that can be later executed on. “It really makes your work easier to be able to sketch something out through AI, show it to your client or boss and then have them give feedback on that, versus creating multiple iterations of the same product,” she said. “It’s a real efficiency driver.” While use of AI technology is clearly on the rise, there are still challenges to full AI adoption, including the lack of: education and training awareness or understanding strategy talent with the right skill sets investment, both of time and of financial resources “Right now, the vast majority of marketers are underutilizing AI. I’ll be honest with you; it will make your job a lot easier. Let’s take advantage of that,” Inge says. Emerging AI Trends in Marketing When marketers develop strategies to figure out what consumers want, they traditionally have examined demographic trends and surveys, plus intuition and assumptions based on past performance. AI has changed that approach dramatically. Algorithms are now analyzing customer interactions in real time, predicting consumer behavior and personalizing content. Recommendation engines analyze browsing history and purchase patterns to suggest products that specific consumers might be interested in. Marketers who once reacted to consumer behavior can now predict it and create personalized campaigns. AI marketing trends Advanced data analytics AI can collect, process, and analyze easily searchable information like names, purchase histories, and website interactions, but can also mine unstructured data such as images, videos, and social media posts to gain insights about consumer preferences, brand perception, and shopping trends. Hyper-personalization AI’s predictive power allows businesses to anticipate customer preferences based on behavior and customize marketing to individual needs and craft experiences that make customers feel seen and valued. Chatbots and virtual assistants Advanced chatbots and assistants can handle customer queries, recommend products, and complete transactions in real time. By identifying products in images, virtual assistants can personalize shopping experiences by informing customers about similar items they might like. AI is transforming how companies engage with their audiences, making marketing more intelligent, data-driven, and responsive to individual customer needs. AI Marketing Tools Spotlight AI tools are empowering marketers to make faster, more informed decisions. Tools like Adobe Sensei and Google Marketing Platform allow marketers to streamline their workflow by integrating data analysis, campaign management, and predictive modeling into a single interface. “I’m using a tool called Blaze that helps you schedule your social media posts. It will give you a whole week or month’s content calendar with the click of a few buttons. I’m also really enjoying using AI to create short explainer videos,” says Inge. ChatGPT Builds chatbots for e-commerce sites and social media platforms, generates leads and personalized email campaigns based on consumer behavior and interests, creates social media campaigns, assists customers through purchasing processes, helps to brainstorm ideas, formulate strategies, and produce content.
