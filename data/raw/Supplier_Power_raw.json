Get started for free Healthcare breakthroughs change the world and bring hope to humanity through scientific rigor, human insight, and compassion. We believe AI can contribute to this, with thoughtful collaboration between researchers, healthcare organizations and the broader ecosystem. Today, we're sharing exciting progress on these initiatives, with the announcement of limited access to Google’s medical large language model, or LLM, called Med-PaLM 2 . It will be available in coming weeks to a select group of Google Cloud customers for limited testing, to explore use cases and share feedback as we investigate safe, responsible, and meaningful ways to use this technology. Med-PaLM 2 harnesses the power of Google’s LLMs, aligned to the medical domain to more accurately and safely answer medical questions. As a result, Med-PaLM 2 was the first LLM to perform at an “expert” test-taker level performance on the MedQA dataset of US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)-style questions, reaching 85%+ accuracy, and it was the first AI system to reach a passing score on the MedMCQA dataset comprising Indian AIIMS and NEET medical examination questions, scoring 72.3%. Industry-tailored LLMs like Med-PaLM 2 are part of a burgeoning family of generative AI technologies that have the potential to significantly enhance healthcare experiences. We’re looking forward to working with our customers to understand how Med-PaLM 2 might be used to facilitate rich, informative discussions, answer complex medical questions, and find insights in complicated and unstructured medical texts. They might also explore its utility to help draft short- and long-form responses and summarize documentation and insights from internal data sets and bodies of scientific knowledge. Innovating responsibly with AI Since last year , we’ve been researching and evaluating Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2, assessing it against multiple criteria — including scientific consensus, medical reasoning, knowledge recall, bias, and likelihood of possible harm — which were evaluated by clinicians and non-clinicians from a range of backgrounds and countries. Med-PaLM 2's impressive performance on medical exam-style questions is a promising development, but we need to learn how this can be harnessed to benefit healthcare workers, researchers, administrators, and patients. In building Med-PaLM 2, we’ve been focused on safety, equity, and evaluations of unfair bias. Our limited access for select Google Cloud customers will be an important step in furthering these efforts, bringing in additional expertise across the healthcare and life sciences ecosystem. What’s more, when Google Cloud brings new AI advances to our products, our commitment is two-fold: to not only deliver transformative capabilities, but also ensure our technologies include proper protections for our organizations, their users, and society. To this end, our AI Principles , established in 2017, form a living constitution that guides our approach to building advanced technologies, conducting research, and drafting our product development policies. From AI to generative AI Google's deep history in AI informs our work in generative AI technologies, which can find complex relationships in large sets of training data, then generalize from what they learn to create new data. Breakthroughs such as the Transformer have enabled LLMs and other large models to scale to billions of parameters, letting generative AI move beyond the limited pattern-spotting of earlier AIs and into the creation of novel expressions of content, from speech to scientific modeling. Google Cloud is committed to bringing to market products that are informed by our research efforts across Alphabet. In 2022, we introduced a deep integration between Google Cloud and Alphabet's AI research organizations, which allows Vertex AI to run DeepMind's groundbreaking protein structure prediction system, AlphaFold . Much more is on the way. In one sense, generative AI is revolutionary. In another, it's the familiar technology story of more and better computing creating new industries, from desktop publishing to the internet, social networks, mobile apps, and now, generative AI. Building on AI leadership Additionally, today we’re announcing a new AI-enabled Claims Acceleration Suite , designed to streamline processes for health insurance prior authorization and claims processing. The Claims Acceleration Suite helps both providers of insurance plans and healthcare to create operational efficiencies and reduce administrative burdens and costs by converting unstructured data into structured data that help experts make faster decisions and improve access to timely patient care. On the clinical side, last year we announced Medical Imaging Suite , an AI-assisted diagnosis technology being used by Hologic to improve cervical cancer diagnoses and Hackensack Meridian Health to predict metastasis in patients with prostate cancer. Elsewhere, Mayo Clinic and Google have collaborated on an AI algorithm to improve the care of head and neck cancers, and Google Health recently partnered with iCAD to improve breast cancer screening with AI. From these examples and more, it's clear that the healthcare industry has moved from testing AI to deploying it to improve workflows, solve business problems, and speed healing. With this in mind, we expect rapid interest in and uptake of generative AI technologies. Healthcare organizations are eager to learn about generative AI and how they can use it to make a real difference. Looking ahead The power of AI has reinforced Google Cloud's commitment to privacy, security, and transparency. Our platforms are designed to be flexible, including data and model lineage capabilities, integrated security and identity management services, support for third-party models, choice and transparency on models and costs, integrated billing and entitlement support, and support across many languages. While we’ll have some innovations like Med-PaLM 2 that are tuned for healthcare, we also have products that are relevant across industries. Last month, we announced several generative AI capabilities coming to Google Cloud, including Generative AI support in Vertex AI and Generative AI App Builder, which are already being tested by a number of customers. Developers and businesses already use Vertex AI to build and deploy machine learning models and AI applications at scale, and we recently added Generative AI support in Vertex AI . This gives customers foundation models they can fine-tune with their own data, and the ability to deploy applicatio"

Recent advances in forecasting utilizing generative AI, in particular large language models (LLMs), highlights untapped potential to overcome real-world data (RWD) challenges such as missingness, noise and limited sample sizes, thus empowering the next generation of AI algorithms in healthcare. Methods We developed the Digital Twin - Generative Pretrained Transformer (DT-GPT) model, which leverages biomedical LLMs using rich electronic health record (EHR) data. Our method eliminates the need for data imputation and normalization, enables forecasting of clinical variables, and prediction exploration via a chatbot interface. We analyzed the method’s performance on RWD from both a long-term US nationwide non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dataset and a short-term intensive care unit (MIMIC-IV) dataset. Findings DT-GPT surpassed state-of-the-art machine learning methods in patient trajectory forecasting on mean absolute error (MAE) for both the long-term (3.4% MAE improvement) and the short-term (1.3% MAE improvement) datasets. Additionally, DT-GPT was capable of preserving cross-correlations of clinical variables (average R 2 of 0.98), and handling data missingness as well as noise. Finally, we discovered the ability of DT-GPT both to provide insights into a forecast’s rationale and to perform zero-shot forecasting on variables not used during the fine-tuning, outperforming even fully trained, leading task-specific machine learning models on 14 clinical variables. Interpretation DT-GPT demonstrates that LLMs can serve as a robust medical forecasting platform, empowering digital twins that are able to virtually replicate patient characteristics beyond their training data. We envision that LLM-based digital twins will enable a variety of use cases, including clinical trial simulations, treatment selection and adverse event mitigation. 1. Introduction Clinical forecasting involves predicting patient-specific health outcomes and clinical events over time, which is of paramount importance for patient monitoring, treatment selection and drug development [ 1 ]. Digital twins are virtual representations of patients that leverage a patient’s medical history to generate detailed multi-variable forecasts of future health states [ 2 ]. The application of digital twins is poised to revolutionize healthcare in areas such as precision medicine, predictive analytics, virtual testing, continuous monitoring, and enhanced decision support [ 3 ]. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) holds promises for creating digital twins due to its potential to produce synthetic yet realistic data, but this area of application is still in its infancy [ 4 ]. Generative AI methods for predicting patient trajectories include recurrent neural networks [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ], transformers [ 9 , 10 ] and stable diffusion [ 11 ]. These often fall short in terms of handling missing data, interpretability and performance. The challenges are partially addressed by causal machine learning [ 12 , 13 , 14 ], however these algorithms face limitations related to small datasets or being confined to simulations [ 15 ]. Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have been achieved with foundation models, which are pre-trained AI models adaptable for various specific tasks involving different types of data. Most foundation models for patient forecasting, e.g. EHRShot [43], focus on single-point predictions [ 16 ] rather than comprehensive longitudinal patient trajectories, which are needed for clinical decision-making. Less explored remain text-focused Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated forecasting capabilities [ 17 , 18 ], including the ability of zero-shot forecasting, i.e. forecasting without any prior specific training in the task [ 19 , 20 ], thus highlighting their remarkable generalizability. We propose the creation of digital twins based on LLMs that leverage data from electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs are a key source of training data for machine learning models in healthcare [ 21 ], as they record patient characteristics such as demographics, diagnoses and lab results over time. However, they pose specific challenges such as data heterogeneity, rare events, sparsity and quality issues [ 16 ]. There have been developments in machine learning to overcome these challenges, especially for data sparsity [ 8 , 11 ], usually by adapting the model’s architecture, resulting in increased model complexity and the introduction of further assumptions on the data. We hypothesize that LLMs will empower digital twins and overcome the above outlined challenges of patient trajectory forecasting. Here, we introduce the Digital Twin - Generative Pretrained Transformer (DT-GPT) model ( Fig. 1 ), which enables: i) forecasting of clinical variable trajectories, ii) zero-shot predictions of unseen clinical variables, and iii) preliminary interpretability utilizing chatbot functionalities. We analyze the performance of the model by forecasting laboratory values on both a long-term (up to 13 week) scale for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, as well predicting short-term (next 24 hours) values for ICU patients. We anticipate that DT-GPT will pave the way for AI-based digital twins in healthcare. Download figure Open in new tab Figure 1: The LLM-based DT-GPT framewo"

It sees AI as strategic for national and economic security. Facing technology export controls from the US, Beijing has made “independent and controllable” AI a key objective. Examining China’s efforts may provide useful learnings for Europe in its own pursuit of digital sovereignty. While China’s government has long identified AI capabilities as a critical goal, it employs different strategies to aid each layer. The heaviest state support is reserved for the capital-intensive semiconductor sector. Indigenization efforts for software frameworks are entrusted to Big Tech companies. Higher layers, i.e., AI models and applications, benefit from an enabling environment but receive less direct state support. China’s semiconductor industry has managed to produce its own AI chips, but their performance does not yet match that of US semiconductor designer Nvidia. Beijing has set indigenous capabilities as a top priority, especially faced with US export controls. Huawei leads this effort, working closely with domestic chipmakers. In models and applications, China is closing in on the US. China is heavily embedded in global open-source communities. Coupled with a protected home market, this has spawned large language model (LLM) developers like DeepSeek. Hardware challenges still hinder wider deployment, but local adoption of LLMs is high, and China’s AI industry is pivoting toward specialized applications. China’s AI ecosystem can source critical inputs domestically, but its future will also hinge on external factors. The country has nurtured a large talent pool, provided ample funding, promoted a maturing data environment and built computing infrastructure. Vulnerabilities include limited access to advanced chips and China’s future participation in the global open-source community, which has long been key for its AI progress. Introduction: China is making rapid progress across the AI tech stack The race for supremacy in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is now at the forefront of geopolitical competition between China and the United States. Not only is AI expected to reshape the way we live and work, but its potential use in military applications could also alter the global balance of power. And some believe that reaching artificial general intelligence, or AGI, where AI surpasses humans in capability, is akin to the race to build the atomic bomb: whoever unlocks AGI first will be the winner of the geopolitical competition. 1 The 2022 release of ChatGPT, the first publicly available generative AI tool based on a large language model (LLM) from US company OpenAI, kicked the AI race into high gear. During the Politburo study session of April 2025, focused on AI, China’s party and state leader Xi Jinping urged a nationwide mobilization to achieve “self-reliance and self-strengthening” (自立自强) in the technology by building an “independent and controllable” (自主可控) ecosystem across hardware and software. 2 The emphasis on AI sovereignty marks a relatively recent turn in Chinese AI strategy and policymaking. Previously, official documents still called for international cooperation. But since the US government’s policy of constraining China’s AI progress, many in China have called to sanction-proof its AI ecosystem. To be self-sufficient, China would need to produce the AI models, the software frameworks needed to create the models, and the chips that fuel their training and deployment – the whole AI technology “stack.” The US has identified AI and the semiconductor technologies that enable its advancements as among several general-purpose “force-multipliers”, and US leadership as a “national security imperative.” 3 Accordingly, Washington has rolled out policies aimed at slowing China’s AI development, primarily through export controls on advanced semiconductors needed to train AI models, as well as on the software and equipment used to manufacture those chips. China’s leaders similarly view advancements in AI as key to national security and overall competitiveness, and they have characterized it as a strategic emerging field that offers the country a historic opportunity to leapfrog the US economically and militarily. Beijing published its first national AI strategy in 2017, outlining steps to become a “major AI innovation center in the world.” 4 US export controls have reinforced Beijing’s conviction that China’s dependency on foreign countries – particularly the US – for its AI future is a national security risk. China is arguably the first country trying to develop a national AI stack, but some in Europe have recently articulated this objective, too. So, where is China now in terms of AI chips, frameworks and applications? Who are the most important players? How is the government shaping the development and adoption of homegrown technology? How does this differ across the stack and why? Understanding China’s AI progress is crucial for European policymakers trying to navigate technology competition – for example to predict US export controls that might affect European companies. It can also help decision makers assess where Europe has leverage and how to engage, including companies that are increasingly embedding local solutions in their offerings for the Chinese market. Moreover, examining China’s self-sufficiency push in AI may also help Europeans predict possible problems in developing a “EuroStack.” 5 Europe has some strategic presence, including key suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and a few notable LLM startups. However, the continent lags in developing and deploying the most advanced AI systems. Growing transatlantic tensions, especially under the new administration of Donald Trump, have renewed calls for “sovereign AI” solutions. 6 China’s AI stack: different layers, different approaches A simplified AI stack consists of three layers: chips that power computations, machine learning frameworks used to build AI models, and applications like large language models (LLMs). Beijing would ideally like self-sufficiency in all areas, but a clear hierarchy is emerging. State support is focused on the lower layers of the stack like chips and frameworks, with higher layers – AI models and applications – benefiting from an enabling environment but much less direct state support. US and allied export controls now restrict sales to China of cutting-edge Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), like those designed by Nvidia, the high-bandwidth memory they are used in conjunction with, and the har"

Key takeaways: Compliance and Security: Ensure HIPAA-compliant encryption and real-time threat detection to avoid fines and protect patient trust. Integration and Data: Seamlessly connect AI to EHRs and validate data like medical images for reliable diagnostics across systems. Cost and ROI: Balance budgets with KPIs like faster triage or reduced billing errors to deliver measurable value. Use Cases and Performance: Leverage AI for oncology analytics or chatbot accuracy, using drift detection to maintain precision. Vendor Expertise and Scalability: Partner with proven vendors offering dedicated support and AI that scales with trends like genomic medicine. For most healthcare leaders, the promise of AI sounds almost too good to ignore — smarter diagnostics, streamlined workflows, 24/7 virtual support, and faster clinical decisions. But step inside a real hospital’s back office, and the picture looks different. Legacy EHR systems resist modern integrations. Clinical teams operate in silos from IT. Compliance is rigid. And vendor conversations often focus more on what’s “possible” than what’s truly practical. The gap between AI’s promise and the day-to-day operational reality remains wide. Meanwhile, the AI-in-healthcare space is overflowing with possibilities. New solutions launch every quarter, each one claiming to transform operations or personalize care. But for healthcare leaders, investing in AI isn’t about chasing the next big thing. It’s about asking the right questions early, so the technology improves care delivery, supports clinicians, and avoids getting lost in complexity. So how do you make the right decision? The truth is, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. Each organization operates under its own set of constraints—from infrastructure limit"

Traffic equated to revenue Adding .com to the end of something made investors throw money at aspiring entrpepeneurs. Startups with no business model bought Super Bowl ads, and many people became papere millionaires over night. During my internship at Sun Microsystems in ’99, I’d drive down 101 past office buildings wrapped in billboards for AltaVista, Excite, and other names destined for extinction. By 2001, those buildings stood empty. The following summer, I went to a launch party where a startup dropped what must have been half a million dollars just to announce they were going to start charging for a product they had been giving away for free. The room was filled with VCs — and no one blinked. By the time I graduated in December 2000, the party was over. From Berkeley, I had the perfect view — just across the bay from the collapse. And now, 25 years later, we’re back. The labels have changed, but the logic hasn’t. “AI-powered” is the new “.com.” Startups pitch wrappers. But this time, many don’t even pretend to own the tech they’re built on. Look closer, and it’s a house of cards: Wrappers rely on OpenAI. OpenAI relies on Microsoft. Microsoft needs NVIDIA. NVIDIA owns the chips that power it all. No one’s in charge. Everyone’s exposed. And no one’s acting like that’s a problem. 2. The Wrappers Problem: Intelligence for Rent Most so-called “AI-powered” tools are just a pretty interface wrapped around OpenAI’s API. It hit me when I looked under the hood of a podcast post-production tool I’d signed up for. The promise? Upload your transcript, get back social posts, summaries, even a newsletter draft. Clean UX, smooth workflow — $60/month. Then I did the math. Zoom image will be displayed If I dropped the same transcript into a folder and called the OpenAI API directly, I could replicate the entire workflow — in five minutes, for under $4. Even without writing code, I could just ask ChatGPT to walk me through it. There was no system. No infrastructure. Just markup. That’s when I realized: these aren’t products. They’re prompt pipelines stapled to a UI. Input: a transcript. Process: a few hardcoded prompts like “summarize this,” “turn it into a tweet,” “generate a LinkedIn post.” Output: formatted text in boxes. No backend. No IP. Just API calls on rails. And they’re charging 50–100/month to do what anyone could replicate for pennies. It’s not just overpriced — it’s dishonest. The entire business model relies on the user not knowing how simple it really is. That’s the heart of the term: LLM wrapper . It’s not a product. It’s a disguise. Want to Try the System That isn't’ a Wrapper? This isn’t markup. It’s your own operating system. Get Early Access. Launch OrchestrateOS — Click Here OpenAI’s Hidden Weakness Everyone treats OpenAI as untouchable — the intelligence layer of the entire industry. Since late 2022, nearly every wrapper, agent, and productivity tool has stood on their shoulders. They built the strongest model. They had the earliest lead. No one has reshaped the market more. And yet, they’re exposed. Their dominance depends on distribution — and distribution comes from the very wrappers everyone dismisses. All those SaaS tools built on top of GPT-4? They’re not just passengers. They’re OpenAI’s customer base. And if even a few of them collapse, API revenue goes with them. This is the hidden risk. Wrappers burn cash on freemium users running token-heavy workflows. But OpenAI still charges them per request. It doesn’t matter if the user pays — the wrapper eats the cost. Their entire business model hinges on converting fast enough to outpace burn. Some will. Most won’t. And when they vanish, OpenAI feels it. That’s the paradox: OpenAI owns the tech, but not the user. Wrappers do. And those wrappers are fragile — thin moats, heavy burn, little lock-in. If they fall, OpenAI doesn’t just lose a customer — it loses the distribution layer that’s propped up non-ChatGPT revenue. It’s not a one-way dependency. It’s a closed loop: OpenAI owns the intelligence. Wrappers own the distribution. Everyone’s pretending the other isn’t critical. But the economics say otherwise. Every token sent through a wrapper — paid or not — earns OpenAI money. Multiply that by millions of freemium users, and these startups become unpaid distribution arms, subsidizing OpenAI’s growth while bleeding out. It’s a clever setup. But it’s brittle. Because if the wrappers go down, OpenAI’s reach shrinks. They can try to convert those users directly — but most of them weren’t signing up for ChatGPT Pro. They showed up for workflow, not raw model access. OpenAI has the moat. They have the model. But they don’t have insulation. Their reach depends on a fragile ring of wrappers, most of which are loss-making, undifferentiated, and burning investor money to survive. When that money dries up, OpenAI loses more than partners — it loses the scaffolding beneath its revenue. And you don’t have to squint to see it. Open Instagram. Scroll through your feed. Dozens of AI tools promise to revolutionize note-taking, health records, podcasting, journaling — all with clean branding, all powered by GPT, and all running the same backend pattern: Take your input Send it to GPT Parse the response Drop it into a UI Call it a product That’s it. And OpenAI gets paid on every call — no matter how thin the differentiation is on the surface. That’s the real exposure: a brittle network of SaaS shells acting as both customer base and growth engine — all margin-negative, all interchangeable, all one policy change away from failure. Still think I’m exaggerating? Here’s what most of these “products” are doing under the hood: # ChatRequest.py import openai def run(prompt): response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model=\"gpt-4\", messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}] ) return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] Then they call it from the terminal: python ChatRequest.py \"Summarize Naval Ravikant’s startup philosophy.\" That’s the product. Everything else is CSS, billing, and a Stripe integration. Swap the prompt, swap the use case: Want tweets from a transcript? Adjust the instruction. Want meeting summaries? Change the input. Want a smart email assistant? Plug in SendGrid. There’s no IP. No system. No moat. Just a well-structured API call, markup, and marketing. Most of the AI product landscape could be rebuilt by a junior dev in under an hour using ChatGPT, Stripe, and boilerplate frontend. That’s the engine behind the hype — and the silent vulnerability behind OpenAI’s strength. The Survivability Math It’s easy to dunk on LLM wrappers for being fragile. But the truth is more tangled. These tools don’t own the intelligence they sell — they rent it. Most rely entirely on OpenAI, Anthropic, or Claude. Their “product” is a UI with a few prompts behind it. Every time a user interacts, they pay the model provider. Unless they’ve built real infrastructure — memory layers, workflow engines, or distribution moats — they’re just middlemen. And middlemen don’t last. But here’s the twist: OpenAI needs them too. Wrappers are the API’s growth engine. They bring GPT to verticals, teams, niches. Kill the wrappers, and OpenAI loses reach and revenue. That interdependence matters — but so does leverage. Survivability comes down to four questions: Who owns the margin? Who controls pricing? Who can switch providers? Who can’t be replaced with a nicer prompt? Let’s break it down: Jasper The golden child. Raised 100M+, hit ~90M ARR, then got kneecapped by ChatGPT. They scrambled: pivoted to enterprise, added model routing, tried building light custom models. They"

As the foundational models get more intelligent, agents’ ability to interact with external tools, data, and APIs becomes increasingly fragmented: Developers need to implement agents with special business logic for every single system the agent operates in and integrates with. It’s clear that there needs to be a standard interface for execution, data fetching, and tool calling. APIs were the internet’s first great unifier—creating a shared language for software to communicate — but AI models lack an equivalent. Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced in November 2024, has gained significant traction within developer and AI communities as a potential solution. In this post, we’ll explore what MCP is, how it changes the way AI interacts with tools, what developers are already building with it, and the challenges that still need solving. Let’s dive in. What is MCP? MCP is an open protocol that allows systems to provide context to AI models in a manner that’s generalizable across integrations. The protocol defines how the AI model can call external tools, fetch data, and interact with services. As a concrete example, below is how the Resend MCP server works with multiple MCP clients. The idea is not new; MCP took inspiration from the LSP (Language Server Protocol) . In LSP, when a user types in an editor, the client queries the language server to autocomplete suggestions or diagnostics. Where MCP extends beyond LSP is in its agent-centric execution model: LSP is mostly reactive (responding to requests from an IDE based on user input), whereas MCP is designed to support autonomous AI workflows. Based on the context, AI agents can decide which tools to use, in what order, and how to chain them together to accomplish a task. MCP also introduced a human-in-the-loop capabilities for humans to provide additional data and approve execution. Popular use cases today With the right set of MCP servers, users can turn every MCP client into an “everything app.” Take Cursor as an example: Although Cursor is a code editor, it’s also a well-implemented MCP client. End users can turn it into a Slack client using the Slack MCP server , an email sender using Resend MCP server , and an image generator using the Replicate MCP server . A more powerful way to leverage MCPs is installing multiple servers on one client to unlock new flows: Users can install a server to generate the front-end UI from Cursor, but also ask the agent to use an image-generation MCP server to generate a hero image for the site. Beyond Cursor, most use cases today can be summarized into either dev-centric, local-first workflows, or net-new experiences using LLM clients. Dev-centric workflows For developers who live and breathe in code every day, a common sentiment is, “I don’t want to leave my IDE to do x ”. MCP servers are great ways to make this dream a reality. Instead of switching to Supabase to check on the database status, developers can now use the Postgres MCP server to execute read-only SQL commands and the Upstash MCP server to create and manage cache indices right from their IDE. When iterating on code, developers can also leverage the Browsertools MCP to give coding agents access to a live environment for feedback and debugging. An example of how Cursor agent uses Browsertools to get access to console logs and other real-time data and debug more efficiently. Outside of workflows that interact with a developer tool, a new use that MCP servers unlock is being able to add highly accurate context to coding agents by either crawling a web page or auto-generating an MCP server based on the documentation. Instead of manually wiring up integrations, developers can spin up MCP servers straight from existing documentation or APIs, making tools instantly accessible to AI agents. This means less time spent on boilerplate and more time actually using the tools — whether it’s pulling in real-time context, executing commands, or extending an AI assistant’s capabilities on the fly. Net-new experiences IDEs like Cursor are not the only MCP clients available, even though they have received the most attention due to MCP’s strong appeal to technical users. For non-technical users, Claude Desktop serves as an excellent entry point, making MCP-powered tools more accessible and user-friendly to a general audience. Soon, we will likely see specialized MCP clients emerge for business-centric tasks such as customer support, marketing copywriting, design, and image editing, as these fields closely align with AI’s strengths in pattern recognition and creative tasks. The design of an MCP client and the specific interactions it supports plays a crucial role in shaping its capabilities. A chat application, for instance, is unlikely to include a vector-rendering canvas, just as a design tool is unlikely to provide functionality for executing code on a remote machine. Ultimately, the MCP client experience defines the overall MCP user experience — and we have so much more to unlock when it comes to MCP client experience. One example of this is how Highlight implemented the @ command to invoke any MCP servers on its client. The result is a new UX pattern in which the MCP client can pipe generated content into any downstream app of choice. An example of Highlight’s implementation of Notion MCP (plugin). Another example is the Blender MCP server use case: Now, amateur users who barely know Blender can use natural language to describe the model they want to build. We are seeing the text-to-3D workflow playing out in real time as the community implements servers for other tools like Unity and Unreal engine. An example of using Claude Desktop with Blender MCP server . Although we mostly think about servers and clients, the MCP ecosystem is gradually shaping up as the protocol evolves. This market map covers the most active areas today, although there are still many blank spaces. Knowing MCP is still in the early days, we’re excited to add more players to the map as the market evolves and matures. (And we will explore some of these future possibilities in the next section.) On the MCP client side, most of the high-quality clients we see today are coding-centric . This is not surprising, since developers are usually early adopters of new technology, but, as the protocol matures, we expect to see more business-centric clients. Most of the MCP servers we see are local-first and focus on single players. This is a symptom of MCP presently only supporting SSE- and command-based connections. However, we expect to see more MCP server adoption as the ecosystem makes remote MCP first-class and MCP adopts Streamable HTTP transport . There is also a new wave of MCP marketplace and server-hosting solutions emerging to make MCP server-discovery possible. Marketplaces like Mintlify ’s mcpt , Smithery , and OpenTools are making it easier for developers to discover, share, and contribute new MCP servers — much like how npm transformed package management for JavaScript or how RapidAPI expanded API discovery. This layer will be crucial for standardizing access to high-quality MCP servers, allowing AI agents to dynamically select and integrate tools on demand. As MC"

(28 pages) At a glance Nearly eight in ten companies report using gen AIâyet just as many report no significant bottom-line impact. 1 â The state of AI: How organizations are rewiring to capture value ,â McKinsey, March 12, 2025. Think of it as the âgen AI paradox.â About the authors This report is a collaborative effort by Alexander Sukharevsky , Dave Kerr , Klemens Hjartar , Lari HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen , StÃ©phane Bout , and Vito Di Leo , with Guillaume Dagorret, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey and McKinsey Technology. At the heart of this paradox is an imbalance between âhorizontalâ (enterprise-wide) copilots and chatbotsâwhich have scaled quickly but deliver diffuse, hard-to-measure gainsâand more transformative âverticalâ (function-specific) use casesâabout 90 percent of which remain stuck in pilot mode. AI agents offer a way to break out of the gen AI paradox. Thatâs because agents have the potential to automate complex business processesâcombining autonomy, planning, memory, and integrationâto shift gen AI from a reactive tool to a proactive, goal-driven virtual collaborator. This shift enables far more than efficiency. Agents supercharge operational agility and create new revenue opportunities. But unlocking the full potential of agentic AI requires more than plugging agents into existing workflows. It calls for reimagining those workflows from the ground upâwith agents at the core. Foreword by Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral AI Weâre at a moment when gen AI has entered every boardroom, but for many enterprises, it still lingers at the edges of actual impact. Many CEOs have greenlit experiments, spun up copilots, and created promising prototypes, but only a handful have seen the needle move on revenue or impact. This report gets to the heart of that paradox: broad adoption with limited return. The current diagnosis is this: Today, AI is bolted on. But to deliver real impact, it must be integrated into core processes, becoming a catalyst for business transformation rather than a sidecar tool. Most deployments today use AI in a shallow wayâas an assistant that sits alongside existing workflows and processesârather than as a deeply integrated, engaged, and powerful agent of transformation. Agentic AI is the catalyst that can make this transition possible, but doing so requires a strategy and a plan to successfully power that transformation. Agents are not simply magical plug-n-play pieces. They must work across systems, reason through ambiguity, and interact with peopleânot just as tools, but as collaborators. That means CEOs must ask different questions: not âHow do we add AI?â but âHow do we want decisions to be made, work to flow, and humans to engage in an environment where software can act?â Redefining how decisions are made, how work is done, and how humans engage with technology requires alignment across goals, tools, and people. That alignment can only happen when openness, transparency, and control are central to your technology and implementationâwhen builders have an open, extensible, and observable infrastructure and users can easily craft and use agents with the confidence that the work of agents is safe, reliable, and under their control. That alignment creates the trust and effectiveness that is the currency of scalable transformation that delivers results rather than regrets. The technology to build powerful agents is already here. The opportunity now is to deploy agents in ways that are deeply tied to how value is created and how people work. That requires an architecture that is modular and resilient and, more importantly, an operating model that centers on humansânot just as users but as co-architects of the systems they will be living and working with. This report lays out the playbook not for tinkering but for reinvention. ROI comes from strong intent: define the outcomes, embed agents deep in core workflows, and redesign operating models around them. Organizations that win will pair a clear strategy with tight feedback loops and disciplined governance, using agents to rethink how decisions are made and how work gets doneâand turning novelty into measurable value. A new AI architecture paradigmâthe agentic AI meshâis needed to govern the rapidly evolving organizational AI landscape and enable teams to blend custom-built and off-the-shelf agents while managing mounting technical debt and new classes of risk. But the bigger challenge wonât be technical. It will be human: earning trust, driving adoption, and establishing the right governance to manage agent autonomy and prevent uncontrolled sprawl. To scale impact in the agentic era, organizations must reset their AI transformation approaches from scattered initiatives to strategic programs; from use cases to business processes; from siloed AI teams to cross-functional transformation squads; and from experimentation to industrialized, scalable delivery. Organizations will also need to set up the foundation to effectively operate in the agentic era. They will need to upskill the workforce, adapt the technology infrastructure, accelerate data productization, and deploy agent-specific governance mechanisms. The moment has come to bring the gen AI experimentation chapter to a closeâa pivot only the CEO can make.

Register here Chapter 1 The gen AI paradox: Widespread deployment, minimal impact Key Points Nearly eight in ten companies have deployed gen AI in some form, but roughly the same percentage report no material impact on earnings. 1 â The state of AI: How organizations are rewiring to capture value ,â McKinsey, March 12, 2025. We call this the âgen AI paradox.â The main issue is an imbalance between âhorizontalâ and âverticalâ use cases. The former, such as employee copilots and chatbots, have been widely deployed but deliver diffuse benefits, while higher-impact vertical, or function-specific, use cases seldom make it out of the pilot phase because of technical, organizational, data, and cultural barriers. Unless companies address these barriers, the transformational promise of gen AI will remain largely untapped. Gen AI is everywhereâexcept in company P&L About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinseyâs AI arm, has been helping businesses create value from AI since 2009, expanding on McKinseyâs technology work over the past 30 years.

What a difference a year makes. Our list has grown by 6X. And still, that’s just scratching the surface of what’s becoming possible with AI across the enterprise. Many of these use cases are coming to life this week at Google Cloud Next 25 , as we join with these customers and partners and thousands more in Las Vegas and virtually around the globe. To name just a few: Wendy’s, Papa John’s pizza, and Uber are all managing orders faster, whether that’s at the drive-thru or through their app with predictive AI tools. Mercedes Benz and General Motors have enhanced in-vehicle services while Samsung’s newest phones and even its in-home robot, Ballie, have more responsive features thanks to AI. Financial institutions like Citi, Deutsche Bank, and Intesa Sanpaolo are providing new services securely, monitoring markets faster, and combatting fraud in novel ways. Given the incredible pace of innovation and progress we continue to see, we are confident that AI will grow beyond even our imagination as our customers continue to challenge us to design, build, deploy, and create value. Hopefully you find something here that will propel our own AI endeavors together. The list is organized by 11 major industry groups, and within those, six agent types: Customer, Employee, Creative, Code, Data, and Security. There are 280 new entries, denoted with an asterisk (*) before the organization’s name. Automotive & Logistics Customer Agents Continental is using Google's data and AI technologies to develop automotive solutions that are safe, efficient, and user-focused.

Our research finds the biggest barrier to scaling is not employees—who are ready—but leaders, who are not steering fast enough. Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AIâs full potential (47 pages) Artificial intelligence has arrived in the workplace and has the potential to be as transformative as the steam engine was to the 19th-century Industrial Revolution. 1 â Gen AI: A cognitive industrial revolution ,â McKinsey, June 7, 2024. With powerful and capable large language models (LLMs) developed by Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, and others, we have entered a new information technology era. McKinsey research sizes the long-term AI opportunity at $4.4 trillion in added productivity growth potential from corporate use cases. 2 â The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier ,â McKinsey, June 14, 2023. Therein lies the challenge: the long-term potential of AI is great, but the short-term returns are unclear. Over the next three years, 92 percent of companies plan to increase their AI investments. But while nearly all companies are investing in AI, only 1 percent of leaders call their companies âmatureâ on the deployment spectrum, meaning that AI is fully integrated into workflows and drives substantial business outcomes. The big question is how business leaders can deploy capital and steer their organizations closer to AI maturity. This research report, prompted by Reid Hoffmanâs book Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future , 3 Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato, Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future , Authors Equity, January 2025. asks a similar question: How can companies harness AI to amplify human agency and unlock new levels of creativity and productivity in the workplace? AI could drive enormous positive and disruptive change. This transformation will take some time, but leaders must not be dissuaded. Instead, they must advance boldly today to avoid becoming uncompetitive tomorrow. The history of major economic and technological shifts shows that such moments can define the rise and fall of companies. Over 40 years ago, the internet was born. Since then, companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft have attained trillion-dollar market capitalizations. Even more profoundly, the internet changed the anatomy of work and access to information. AI now is like the internet many years ago: The risk for business leaders is not thinking too big, but rather too small. The Future of Business: 13 technology trends that matter Tuesday, July 29th 10:30 - 11:00 a.m. EDT / 4:30 - 5:00 p.m. CEST Join McKinsey's Michael Chui, Roger Roberts, and Lareina Yee as they share our latest research on how leaders can capture value from the 13 technology trends that are potentially reshaping industries and creating new growth opportunities. Theyâll explore how AI is powering innovation across industries, how technologies like agentic AI and autonomous systems are gaining momentum, and what leaders can do to stay ahead. Register here This report explores companiesâ technology and business readiness for AI adoption (see sidebar âAbout the surveyâ). It concludes that employees are ready for AI. The biggest barrier to success is leadership. About the survey To create our report, we surveyed 3,613 employees (managers and independent contributors) and 238 C-level executives in October and November 2024. Of these, 81 percent came from the United States, and the rest came from five other countries: Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. The employees spanned many roles, including business development, finance, marketing, product management, sales, and technology. All the survey findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses and those from other regions. Chapter 1 looks at the rapid advancement of technology over the past two years and its implications for business adoption of AI. Chapter 2 delves into the attitudes and perceptions of employees and leaders. Our research shows that employees are more ready for AI than their leaders imagine. In fact, they are already using AI on a regular basis; are three times more likely than leaders realize to believe that AI will replace 30 percent of their work in the next year; and are eager to gain AI skills. Still, AI optimists are only a slight majority in the workplace; a large minority (41 percent) are more apprehensive and will need additional support. This is where millennials, who are the most familiar with AI and are often in managerial roles, can be strong advocates for change. Chapter 3 looks at the need for speed and safety in AI deployment. While leaders and employees want to move faster, trust and safety are top concerns. About half of employees worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will get AI right. The onus is on business leaders to prove them right, by making bold and responsible decisions. Chapter 4 examines how companies risk losing ground in the AI race if leaders do not set bold goals. As the hype around AI subsides, companies should put a heightened focus on practical applications that empower employees in their daily jobs. These applications can create competitive moats and generate measurable ROI. Across industries, functions, and geographies, companies that invest strategically can go beyond using AI to drive incremental value and instead create transformative change. Chapter 5 looks at what is required for leaders to set their teams up for success with AI. The challenge of AI in the workplace is not a technology challenge. It is a business challenge that calls upon leaders to align teams, address AI headwinds, and rewire their companies for change. Chapter 1 An innovation as powerful as the steam engine Imagine a world where machines not only perform physical labor but also think, learn, and make autonomous decisions. This world includes humans in the loop, bringing people and machines together in a state of superagency that increases personal productivity and creativity (see sidebar âAI superagencyâ). This is the transformative potential of AI, a technology with a potential impact poised to surpass even the biggest innovations of the past, from the printing press to the automobile. AI does not just automate tasks but goes further by automating cognitive functions. Unlike any invention before, AI-powered software can adapt, plan, guideâand even makeâdecisions. Thatâs why AI can be a catalyst for unprecedented economic growth and societal change in virtually every aspect of life. It will reshape our interaction with technology and with one another. Scientific discoveries and technological innovations are stones in the cathedral of human progress. Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and Inflection AI, partner at Greylock Partners, and author Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acqui"
